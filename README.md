# RShiny Project
### A platform to develop forecasting models and evaluate. The platform allows you to load the data, transform and build forecasting models using FB Prophet and Dynamic Regression.
### The tool outputs the results on a dygraph showcasing actual vs predicted graph and also provides you the graph of point accuracy. This helps identifying the points where the error is too high and help in tuning the model.
### The tool also has a capability to test the robustness of the developed model by carrying out moving window validation.
